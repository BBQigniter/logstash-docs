[[logstash-2-4]]
=== Logstash 2.4 Release Notes

* Backported Event get/set API. These changes enable Logstash 2.4 to install plugins 
  that use the 5.0 API ({lsissue}5449[Issue 5449]).
* Added support for logging Logstash's logs in JSON format. Using command line flag 
  `--log-in-json` users can specify that Logstash write its own logs in JSON ({lsissue}1569[Issue 1569]).
* Plugin Generator: Added a subcommand `generate` to `bin/logstash-plugin`. This 
  bootstraps a new plugin with the right directory structure and all the required files (templates).

==== Input Plugins

*`Beats`*:

* Beats input has been reimplemented using Netty, an asynchronous IO framework for Java. 
  This rewrite for performance brings it in line with Logstash Forwarder + LS combination 
  (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/92[Issue 92])
